# Wonderful Polish Language

## Preamble (Wstęp - Preambuła)

Hello, I am Dominik 'Domcio' Karol [Wolfgang] (From the Catholic Sacrament Of Confirmation, so it doesn't really count, but it is still worth to mention this powerful name) Rajchel and  I am currently 18 years old. I go to IT school. I have created for you this wonderful list - document of resources for learning - getting more experience with Polish language - I mainly dedicate it to foreigners who are looking for [re]sources to learn the Polish language , but also to my compatriots and aliens [and parrots] and not only for beginners or advanced people, this list is also useful for natives who are looking for new sources of education and entertainment in their language. I think this [**POWERFUL**] Polish is a really great language. Thanks to its flexibility you can create great compositions - poems etc. That's why I would like to really help promote it. Personally, I am constantly expanding the number of known words, because it is a very useful thing in my life. I learn English from the first grade of elementary school ([Szkoła podstawowa](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szko%C5%82a_podstawowa)) and German from the first grade of middle school ([Gimnazjum](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimnazjum)), but I give less priority to German because it would only be useful for me to read [Grimms' Fairy Tales in the original language](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimms_M%C3%A4rchen). At home I learn mainly Japanese. In the future I am also going to learn other Slavic languages a bit more. The order of the links is mostly random. I add clean links, without any extra and referral code in URLs. Currently I'm focusing on adding free and legal sources or those that also offer free legal content. Maybe in the future I'll also add categories with paid (also legal xD) websites. I hope that the first version of my list is satisfactory, I wanted to publish it in a sensible form. If you know any other good [free :D] websites related to Polish, feel free to let me know when a website has stopped distributing content in an fair way, please report it to me, also in case the website end its activity or changes the URL or project name or the page I added is "really uncool". Pozdrawiam. Have fun.

(I offered the hamsters that destroyed the cables from the teleports to cooperate in searching for bugs in the text code. After that I repaired the teleport connections, so in this version all should work)

- [Youglish](https://youglish.com/polish) - really smart website for improving pronunciation and more. As the authors write, there are millions of entries with tracks in the index, after entering a word that interests us, the search engine will try to find a movie on YouTube from their subtitles - someone's speech, in which the word you have chosen.

## Videos (Filmy)

All these productions, including animated "long time movies" can be watched for free and legally on their channel. Currently there are also films of drawing characters from their production. These are cult productions that were part of many people's childhood (The same as the Czech ["Krtek"](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krecik)) and "[Pat a Mat]([https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C4%85siedzi_(serial_animowany)](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sąsiedzi_(serial_animowany)))" and "[O loupežníku Rumcajsovi"]([https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rozb%C3%B3jnik_Rumcajs](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rozbójnik_Rumcajs))).
- [Studio Miniatur Filmowych](https://www.youtube.com/user/StudioMiniaturF) - The official YouTube channel of "Studio Miniatur Filmowych" - Another great studio that created such great productions as ["Dziwne przygody Koziołka Matołka"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l3swTSo1_I)) and ["Pomysłowy Dobromir"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEASuS_2GpQ)).

### Pingwin Mroźny

[Pingwin Mroźny (Penguin Frosty)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdhssPbvaKk&list=PL2yH5_nRkFqwAI-ulb6y8j-AfOiMKGLCN&index=2) - This is a character created by me (Pingwin - first name and Mroźny - surname). The mascot of my main channel and artistic activity. I created a whole Universe around him. Each "typical" episode is intended to introduce the viewer to some kind of profession (the core of the Penguin's movements themselves refers to the film [Wonsz żeczny (humorous record of correct form "wąż rzeczny")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVPj0phGjyU), which is still present in Poland or was present in the old times - "extinct professions" and sometimes there were references to historical characters, I also invented some of my own professions. Here is [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HyAuXibszs), in which I described "how to get to know this universe so as not to get lost in it", i.e. I presented the chronology, because I created a lot of films, as well as a [short] [computer game](https://gamejolt.com/games/pingwinmroznypoczatek/343963) and [also] a [short story](https://www.wattpad.com/594393714), so the viewer could get lost in my universe without it. A lot of people will ask "Why?", at that time my head was like a locomotive from which the steam flew all the time, so I wanted to find my way to "express myself artistically" and eventually I did it in this form, but I tried very hard, so these are not the kind of films you would think if you look at them out of context. I also started to promote this kind of "pseudo-animation", which I personally called "dead animation". In other film forms, a revolution began to take place, just like in Antic Theater - more [voice] actors (synthesizer voices) began to arrive. I am most pleased with the series ["Przygody Pingwinbada Żeglarza"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUnP-kDL284&list=PL2yH5_nRkFqxtW04-v-yDyB7QUD__oAmn) (The name refers to:  ["Przygody Sindbada Żeglarza" by Bolesław Leśmianan]([https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przygody_Sindbada_%C5%BBeglarza](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przygody_Sindbada_Żeglarza)) and it's wordplay) ["Pingwinia Komedia"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUnP-kDL284&list=PL2yH5_nRkFqxtW04-v-yDyB7QUD__oAmn) (The name refers to: "Boska Komedia" - Polish translation of "Divine Comedy" by Dante Alighieri). and from [the first episode of the "Danse Pingvinabre"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O15T5evhnQk) (The name refers to the medieval Danse Macabre) series. I wanted to include this long description (and I created a separate subcategory) in this list as "the main reward of my work", because I want to leave some remembrance and awareness in people to remember my works and also to open the door to potential cooperation and job. 

### YouTube

(I like to add those channels that do not have exaggerate with the absurdity of thumbnails and titles - clickbaits. I want to make it as easy as possible to retrieve information from the videos on this site without wasting your time on "one million fillers" included in today's **typical** YouTube videos focused on massive marketing).

- [Course of Polish](https://www.youtube.com/user/Jareczny) - There are a lot of "words of the day" here, and then the speaker shows the sentences in which these words can be used - context.
- [SAY IT IN POLISH](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCDOVLmcmVWGit5vTgS2Q6Q) - Nice channel about "saying it" (some more complex message) in Polish. And not only that, it is also worthwhile to look through older videos.
- [Ignacy z Japonii](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC84AaEtr7hlaYYwXDSKAbNg) - Very cool channel of a Japanese man named Kohei, who records videos under the pseudonym "Ignacy" ([Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjWU4MClUbQ)). The channel might be useful for people from Japan who would like to learn Polish and more, because "Ignacy" was a free listener in Polish studies at the Uniwersytet Śląski in Katowice, as he himself wrote in the description of the channel. He explains very interesting issues, refutes myths and stereotypes related to Japan or Japanese, which people spread unconsciously in Poland (and not only here).  
- [Skazany na film](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ROk73ZAWnDk6VS5kXTzVQ) - A great channel about film, where the author describes things from this world in a very inspiring way.
- [Polimaty](https://www.youtube.com/Polimaty) - Very interesting channel about nice life topics (yes, it's worth to check it).
- [Na Gałęzi](https://www.youtube.com/user/NaGalezi) - Another channel dedicated to films, there is a lot of humor here.
- [Polski z Anią](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOJ8InFS6bdCVzsZKIdmK4w) - Good channel about parts of speech, conjugation and times and much more. Currently the project has been [maybe temporarily] paused ([Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi9gW7pAfWQ)).
- [LEARN POLISH WITH DAREK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkyows0QsBOlvEQz4m3yGvg) - Another [also paused :/] interesting channel about Polish. Very cool option for people who want to learn words while listening, because there are a lot of such materials. 
- [PolishPod101](https://www.youtube.com/user/PolishPod101) - Very active and professional channel. There is a huge number of films and 24/7 live streaming for learning. 
- [Grupa Filmowa Darwin (G.F. Darwin)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkPjHTuNd_ycm__29dXM3Nw) - A film group making really great films. With its latest films it refers to the problems affecting today's [especially Polish] society. The main popularity of this YouTube channel has been brought by films from the "Wielkie Konflikty" series, as well as a parody of the song "Will You Be There" by Micheal Jackson entitled ["Orki z Majorki"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZuFsI-bttM) (About [oceanic] orcas (killer whale) from Mallorca).
- [Klocuch](https://www.youtube.com/user/KlocuchRecenzje) - [Mr Cuch's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS3xkUyqyUQ) YouTube channel. This is one of the legends of Polish YouTube, which shares its opinions on various topics in a very unconventional way, and you should not take things that he says personally, because all these words are said in a joke or some philosophical aspect (he often refers to things related to the childhood of many Poles). I also add it here because he speaks a very diverse language - he uses words from many dialects and loan words (a lot of German origin).
- [Historia bez cenzury](https://www.youtube.com/user/HistoriaBezCenzuryMB) - The historical channel, where the main anchorman - Wojciech Drewniak presents history in a cool, eccentric and humorous way. There is also an [English version](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd51P-3L-OiG-L4NH36ArAA/videos), but after three films this project has been stopped.
- [Mówiąc Inaczej](https://www.youtube.com/user/PamikuPL) - great and very popular YouTube channel about "How to speak Polish correctly".
- [Arlena Witt](https://www.youtube.com/user/jezykalnia) - A channel to learn English, but of course you can also use a magic trick and learn Polish from it.

- [My playlist with "The best of Polish music creations"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCw3rMng0nw&list=PL2yH5_nRkFqwxh63njdnt3emJ0rq0f2fp) - I have created a playlist of songs that are memorable, also a part of the Polish culture, often many jokes - references to them. I update it from time to time as soon as I have a "marathon of listening to music". So that's the playlist of "core songs of Poland" (But there's not much Disco Polo here anyway, I keep it to a minimum because it's still a subjective playlist, and I'm already bored with this genre and I think then that it's mostly "homogenous"). I'm also interested in Polish music from different times, so you'll find some older songs there, I'm also trying to add the best quality version to the playlist, and not thrown by a third party in very poor and even more compressed quality.
- [Studio Accantus](https://www.youtube.com/StudioAccantus) - A project associating brilliant vocalists, who together perform e.g. covers of great famous Polish songs, often from animated fairy tales. It is worth to watch - listen to those performances, because they are in really good quality. 
- [WIDZĘ GŁOSY](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsS2pcVBbDAdn8pPoh0mUkQ) - A channel where the most famous Polish voice actors are interviewed. Often you can learn from them many interesting stories from the realization of a given project and observations of the actors themselves. Often the actors sing songs that they have sung in a polish versions of movies productions. Of course, these are usually songs from the old days, so you can observe the voice changes of such people.
- [Polskie Podcasty](http://polskiepodcasty.pl/wszystkie-podcasty) - catalog of polish podcasts.
- [Katalog Biblioteki Polskiej](http://katalog.bibliotekapiosenki.pl/) - A catalog of Polish songs.

There are usually several versions available in one archive file, i.e. versions with extra settings and the original version without any additional settings.

### Song lyrics, notes and tabs (Teksty piosenek, nuty i taby)

- [Tekstowo](https://www.tekstowo.pl) - one of the currently most popular Polish websites offering lyrics to songs. Transcriptions are created by users. You will need it if you want to learn a language by listening to songs, because you will be able, for example, to listen and read at the same time or you can try to write down what you heard and then check the lyrics of the song to see if it is correct, it is certainly a nice method and quite mind friendly and not boring in my opinion. 
- [Groove](https://www.groove.pl) - Another option, there are a lot of song interpretations and, of course, the subtitles themselves, so this will come in handy if we want to understand the deeper meaning of the tracks. Sometimes you have to do some research anyway to find out what song had the true message, especially in case of old Polish songs, like those from the 80s. If you haven't found the meaning of a song, write to me, then I'll try to help you interpret it by helping you know the history of those times and knowing the people who lived then, because I'm from 2001, so hehehe. but I still have a lot of knowledge on this issue, and I also got to know a part of the biographies of the local music artists, which can be useful in this regard.

The voices of the characters are from very popular voice actors, and documentary films about these actors have been made as part of the project, so it is worth watching them on [the project's official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzZPtg45BJjKpxSB2ER1mxw).

## My nice tips (Moje świetne wskazówki)

- In Polish, there is such a thing that some sentences can be shortened. For example, instead of saying: "Jesteś mądry" [masculinum -y] or "Jesteś mądra" [femininum -a] (You are smart), you can tell: "Mądryś"  or "Mądraś" (Yes, -**ś** from jeste**ś**) or "Jesteś odważny" or "Jesteś odważna" (You are brave) = "Odważnyś" or "Odważnaś" or "Jesteś miły" or "Jesteś miła" (You are nice) = "Miłyś" or "Miłaś". If you want to become a knight or lady, it may come in handy to you, because it sounds a bit archaic, but I always remember that it's a cool thing, so I created this category to share such cool things with you.
- The word "spoko" (comes from the word: "**spoko**jnie" - calmly) is a very useful and universal word. You can use it instead of "Nie ma za co" (You're welcome) and also "Nie ma problemu" (No problem), so when, for example, a neighbor apologizes to you that a his piano fell out of his window into your garden, you can tell him: "Spoko". You can say that you like something, e.g. "Ten film jest spoko" ("This movie is cool"). It is from many years a very popular word, so even the older ones will understand. Of course, it can be used to, for example, soothe someone nervous - "Spoko, wszystko będzie w porządku" (Chill, everything will be fine). Or you can confirm something with this word e.g. someone asks you if you want to go to the cinema, then if you want to, you say "Spoko" ("Yes" in this case). So, if you are afraid to use the word "w porządku" and you still use "**ok**ay/okey(/okej)", then "spoko" can be a cool alternative for you. Of course it's a slang word, so if you use it during a "serious conversation", someone might get the impression that you're a "relaxed kind of human", although that's good, because at least they will know you're an honest man.

You can meet many interesting people here, but you can also find a lot of "suspicious people", so be careful. (M - mężczyzna - male, K - kobieta - female, so at the beginning of the conversation, when someone writes "K", it means that she says she is a woman, it's a pattern that often occurs, or e.g. M20 = a man who is 20 years old, for some people it's just something like a dating chat).
